# AGENTS

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Conventions
- Keep Python code readable with clear, pedagogical comments explaining non-obvious steps.
- Prefer explicit variable names over abbreviations unless standard (e.g., `dx`, `dy`).
- Update README.md when behavior or usage changes.
- Regenerate the requirements.txt when needed.
